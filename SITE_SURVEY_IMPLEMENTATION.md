# Site Survey Form Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated a comprehensive site survey form into the FairFence Contracting application. The form allows customers to submit detailed quote requests with multiple fence lines and photo uploads.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)
Created three new tables:
- **site_surveys**: Main survey data (customer info, property address, removal requirements)
- **fence_lines**: Multiple fence line specifications per survey
- **survey_photos**: Photo uploads linked to surveys

All tables include:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Public insert policies (anyone can submit)
- Authenticated read/update/delete policies (admin access)
- Proper indexes for performance
- CASCADE deletion for related records

### 2. Storage Infrastructure
- Created `survey-photos` Supabase Storage bucket
- 5MB per photo limit
- Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, and HEIC formats
- Public read access for photos
- Organized storage path structure

### 3. Frontend Component (`RequestQuote.tsx`)
Located at: `client/src/components/forms/RequestQuote.tsx`

Features:
- **Customer Information Section**: Name, phone, email, property address
- **Dynamic Fence Lines**: Add/remove multiple fence lines with:
  - Line description
  - Length (metres)
  - Height selection (1.2m, 1.8m, 2.1m, Custom)
  - Fence type dropdown (15+ options)
  - Conditional rails/wires field for farm fencing
  - Special notes per line
- **Additional Work Section**: Removal checkbox, additional notes
- **Photo Upload Section**:
  - Multiple photo selection (up to 20 photos)
  - Real-time preview with thumbnails
  - Individual photo removal
  - File validation (size, type)
  - Direct upload to Supabase Storage
- **Privacy Notice**: Complies with Privacy Act 2020
- Styled to match existing FairFence orange/black theme
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Form validation and error handling

### 4. Backend API Endpoint

- Photo metadata storage
- Email notification to alex@fairfence.co.nz
- Error handling and logging

### 5. Email Notification System
Added `sendSiteSurveyEmail()` function in `server/email.ts`

- Additional work requirements
- Plain text fallback version
- NZ timezone timestamp
- Sent to: alex@fairfence.co.nz
