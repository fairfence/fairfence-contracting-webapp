# DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
# - For local development: Keep this file as .env in your project root (already gitignored)
# - For Bolt deployment: Set these variables in Bolt's environment settings
# - NEVER commit the .env file with real values to version control
# - The .gitignore file already includes .env to prevent accidental commits

# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is safe to expose (protected by RLS policies)
# 2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY must NEVER be exposed to client-side code
# 3. Rotate SESSION_SECRET regularly in production
# 4. Use different API keys for development and production environments
# 5. Monitor SendGrid usage to detect unauthorized access
